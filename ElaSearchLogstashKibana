1) What is the ELK Stack?
The ELK Stack is a collection of three open-source products â€” Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana.

E stands for Elasticsearch: used for storing logs
L stands for Logstash : used for both shipping as well as processing and storing logs
K stands for Kibana: is a visualization tool (a web interface).

2) How is the logs pushed from the ec2-intances ?
A beats agent called FileBeat is installed in all the ec2-instances. It is a lightweight log shipper. FileBeat will listen to the log paths configured and push the logs to 
Logstash whenever there is a change in the file.

3) What is the high level flow of the ELK stack? 

 log -> beats(data collection) -> logstash(data processing) -> elastic search(storage) -> kibana(Visualize).

4) How does FileBeat know the paths to listen ?
There is a YML file available where we have configured the paths to listen. Below are the paths configured.

/apps/support/logs/httpd/access_log*
/apps/support/logs/httpd/error_log*
/apps/*SEC/logs/SEC/?/*.log*
/apps/??/logs/*/*/*.log*
/jboss/support/logs/eap/*/*.log*

5) I have few logs written in the path which is not mentioned above, What should i do ?
Please email to to get it added asap.

6) How many days logs will be available in ELK ?
Current day and n-1 day logs will be available in ELK. The previous days logs are moved to S3 and using the in house tool - we can download the previous days logs.

7) How is resilience achieved in ELK  ?
We have a 3 node cluster for the ELK and there is replication available.

8) How do i monitor the health check of ELK ?
It can be monitored in Kibana - using the Stack Monitoring menu.

9) Apart from log analysis, what other feature are available in ELK ?
Like file beat that pushes logs, there is another beats agent called MetricBeat installed in the ec2 instances which will push the system metrics like CPU usage, disk space available etc
Custom dashboards are available in ELK to monitor the performance and application health check

10) Do we have ITRS available in Cloud to trigger alerts for the constrained scenarios ?
No, though ITRS is available in Cloud, we will proceed to use ELK watcher module to trigger alerts whenever there are some specific error patterns are written in the log.

11) I have few patterns to be configured for triggering alerts, whom should i contact ? 
Please email to  to get it added asap.
