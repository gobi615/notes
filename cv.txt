OpenCV is image processing lib. toGreyScale, BRGtoRGB,
OpenCV reads in images in BGR format

python libs
numpy
matplotlib.image as as mpimg - # for reading in images
matplotlib.pyplot as plt - to plot image
cv2 - # computer vision library

read image from file.
change image to grey color using cv2 lib. which gives image in a 2D array. --(do some modification in the number if want)

Read in the image
Print out the type of image data and its dimensions (height, width, and color)
Make a copy of the image
Change color to RGB (from BGR)
Display the image copy
TODO: Define the color selection boundaries in RGB values. play around with these values until you isolate the blue background
Define the masked area
Vizualize the mask
Mask the image to let the pizza show through
Load in a background image, and convert it to RGB 
Crop it to the right size (514x816)
Mask the cropped background so that the pizza area is blocked
Display the background
