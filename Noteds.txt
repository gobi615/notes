To move an object either use physics(prefered) or transaform.

RgidBody - 
  isKinametic - is having rigidbody but using transaform to move obj bcos physics wont work in the object when isKinametic is selected.
  apply force through addForce/addTorque to transform the obj through phy. 
  Physics also modifies the transform/rotate property. 
  should apply colliders to work on the force.
  Drag -> 0.001 means solid block of metal
  Drag -> 10 means feather
  If moving transform of a obj and want collision/trigger event attach a rigidbody to it. 
  Ang.Dray -> infinity doesnot mean it wont rotate
  

Colliders
  Primitive colliders less cpu intense
  Mesh - Mesh collider wont work.
  Mesh - Mesh(Convex enabled) collider will work.
  use primitive colider for moving obj, mesh collider for stationery obj
  compound collider - Collection of primitive/covex mesh collider added to an game object as child objet.
  Continuous Collision Detection
  In Compound Colliders, there should be one rigidbody to the root game object
  primitive collider wont work correctly with shear transforms
  Static Collider -> motionless objs, dont have rigidbody and wont move on collision
  Dynamic Colliders -> have rigibody, move on collisioin
  if a isTrigger enabled then it doesnt behave as a solid object, will allow other collider to pass through. 
  when collisions occur and initiate actions using the OnCollisionEnter function
  When a collider enters its space, a trigger will call the OnTriggerEnter function
  OnCollisionEnter - When touching first
  OnCollisionStay - During touching
  OnCollisionExit - when releasing the touch
  OnTriggerEnter, OnTriggerStay and OnTriggerExit 
  for non trigger collision -> one of the obj should be non kinametic rigidBody, other wise OnCollisionEnter wont called.
  with triger collisioin this restriction doesnt apply
  Static Collider, The Rigidbody Collider and the Kinematic Rigidbody Collider.
  If a obj need to trigger collision event and not want physics to move it then kinametic RigidBdy Colider needed   
  
 Difference BTW OnCollision and OnTrigger  
    The scripting system can detect when collisions occur and initiate actions using the OnCollisionEnter function. 
    However, you can also use the physics engine simply to detect when one collider enters the space of another without 
    creating a collision. A collider configured as a Trigger (using the Is Trigger property) does not behave as a solid 
    object and will simply allow other colliders to pass through. When a collider enters its space, a trigger will call the 
    OnTriggerEnter function on the trigger objectâ€™s scripts. 
  
  
 Physics Material
   When colliders interact, their surfaces need to simulate the properties of the material they are supposed to represent.
   The Physic Material is used to adjust friction and bouncing effects of colliding objects.
   
 Scripts   
  Awake - Called for every obj when scene loads.
  Start - Called before Update method. Eg. Initilization 
  Update - calls for every frame. Eg. User Input, 
  FixedUpdate - caled on fixed interval time. Eg. Physics Obj
  LateUpdate - Called after Update method. Eg. for Camera to follow
  Every components is a class
  Controlling GameObjects
    - To take reference of a componet within same GameObject (-- Rigidbody rb = GetComponent<Rigidbody>(); ) with that you can change 
      variable value or call method of that component. 
    - NullReference error thrown if the component is not available.
    - To link component of other GameObject, create a public variable in script with the component type and drag and assign 
      the other GameObject in inspector. 
    - Or can create a GameObject type and assign a GO. Ref the component with the GO in script.
    - To Find GameObject at RunTime
        - To get Similar GO Use the foreach method to get all child GO in an array. (transform.childCount, Transform[] ...)
        - To get specific child GO use the -- transform.Find("Gun");
        - To get GO using name -- GameObject.Find("MainHeroCharacter");
        - To get Go using tag -- GameObject.FindWithTag("Player"); , GameObject.FindGameObjectsWithTag("Enemy");
        - To instantiate a GO use the Instantiate(GameObject, transform.poisition, transform.rotation) method.
        - 
    - Events
        - Regular Update Events (Update, FixedUpdate, LastUpdate)
        - OnGUI() -- GUI event. 
        - OnCollisionEnter(), onTriggerEnter() -- phy event
    - Time/Frame 
        - Time.fixedDeltaTime --> To get/update FixedUpdate time event. 
        - 
    - Keyframe Animation
        - Record an action and create an animation from it. eg. change color
        - it usefull if the movement is constant and not require change in the game. 
    - Sprite Animation
        - split the sprite in sprite editor.
        - create a gameObj and add sprite renderer, animation component.
        - select all images and create the animation. 
        - Drag a GameObj on to it.
        - Create a animation controller and drag the animation to animation controller.
        - add animation controller to the animation component.
    - Animation Controller
        - created from animation. Has all different state of the object which is animated in the scene. eg. a man in the scene.
        - need to add transition between state. eg. idle-->walk/idle--->run/idle -->jump and same for walk and jump
    - Keyframe Event
        - Can add an event at a particular keyframe in the animation which calls to the method inside the scrip component for that gameObj.
        - can be usefull to add a controll in the animation. eg. changing speed, color
    - Coroutine -> to create multiple of same gameObject
